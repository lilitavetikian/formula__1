        <h1 id="russel">Russell describes 2023 season as 'very strange' 
            after a string of 'missed opportunities'</h1>
        <img src="" alt="">
        <p>George Russell admits he will be searching for answers this winter in a 
            bid to understand why he and Mercedes missed out on plenty of opportunities during a 
            “strange” 2023 season, despite having “upped” his performances.
        </p>
        <p>
            Russell achieved just two podium finishes this year – in Spain and in 
            Abu Dhabi – compared to seven in 2022. He also scored 175 points in this year’s championship – 100 less 
            than he did last year when he finished fifth – and wound up in eighth.
        </p>
        <p>
            Along with that, Russell’s season was marred by a few unenforced errors 
            that saw his hopes of a podium fade in Canada, Monaco, and Singapore, 
            as well as reliability issues in Australia and Sao Paulo. 
        </p>
        <p>
            When asked how he would reflect on the year, Russell replied: 
            <blockquote class="blockquote-6">
               <p> “It's been a very, very strange season. It’s been a season where we've had a lot of 
                    pace at times, but never achieved the results that I felt were deserved or were possible.
                    “So, we definitely need to try and understand why that was. 
                    There's been a huge amount of missed opportunities in many regards. 
                    It really hasn't been a smooth season. But I think when everything's 
                    flowing, when everything's working right, luck tends to be on your side.
                </p>
            </blockquote>
        </p>
        <p>
            “But when, you know, you're on the backfoot, you tend to have bad luck. 
            I'm not one for believing in luck. I think you make your own luck. 
            So, we just need to be faster and lady luck will be with us.”
        </p>
        <p>
            When asked to compare his 2023 season to his 2022 campaign – in which he 
            finished in the top five 20 times and recorded his maiden F1 victory 
            in Sao Paulo – Russell answered: “It’s definitely something I'm going 
            to look at over the winter.
        </p>
        <p>
            <blockquote class="blockquote-6">
               <p>
                “The results were so smooth-flowing last year, I think we finished in the top 
                five more than any other driver. And this year, I feel that I've upped my game 
                in my quali pace and upped my game in my race pace, and we've definitely been on the backfoot.
                “But we definitely have more competition this year. With McLaren joining the
                 fight in the second half, Aston being there at the start of the season. 
                 But ultimately… eyes on next year.”

        <img src="" alt="">
        <p>
            Looking ahead to 2024, Russell also gave his view on the task facing Mercedes
             over the winter as they look to close the gap to rivals Red Bull in 
             the hopes of challenging for the title.
        </p>
        <p>
            “I think the task for everybody is massive,” Russell explains.  
        </p>

            <blockquote class="blockquote-6">
                <p>
                    “We're all trying to catch up to the most dominant car in F1 history. 
                    So that's no short 
                    task, and everybody's going to have to come together, really focused, really
                     put everything into it and time will tell.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “But I think we're going into this winter in a much better place 
                    than we were 12 months ago and two years ago. So, we hope we're 
                    not going to stumble over anything. But as I said, time will tell.”

            'He reached out to me' – Hamilton denies approaching Horner regarding possible 2024 Red Bull seat
        </h1>
        <p>
            Lewis Hamilton has denied claims that he approached Christian Horner earlier this season about the possibility of driving for Red Bull, instead saying that the Team Principal made the first contact.
        </p>
        <p>
            Hamilton entered the season without a contract for 2024 with Mercedes, leading to plenty of media speculation that he could possibly end his decade-long stint with the Silver Arrows, and sign for one of their rivals in the paddock.
        </p>
        <p>
            But Hamilton put those stories to bed when it was announced that he had signed a two-year contract extension with Mercedes back in September.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, this week a report surfaced in which Horner claimed that a member of Hamilton’s representatives contacted him regarding the possibility of the Briton driving for Red Bull in 2024. Previous reports had also claimed that the seven-time world champion had spoken to Ferrari – something which Hamilton denied earlier in the year.
            Speaking ahead of this weekend’s season finale in Abu Dhabi, Hamilton was asked about Horner’s comments. He said: “I’ve not approached Christian; I haven’t spoken to Christian for years and no one from my team has.
        </p>
        <p>
            <blockquote class="blockquote-6">
                <p>
                    “I’ve checked with everyone, no one from my team has reached out to him. However, he had reached out to me about meeting up at the end of the season.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “And I was like, ‘I hope you are well; I wish you all the best, congratulations on an amazing season so far, and I hope that I am able to compete with you in the near future.’”
                </p>
            </blockquote>
        </p>  
        <p>
            Hamilton will now turn his attentions to the track where Mercedes face intense competition from Ferrari for second place in the constructors’ championship. They lead the Scuderia by just four points and Hamilton knows he and his team have their work cut out for them if they are to come out on top.
            <blockquote class="blockquote-6">
                <p>
                    “I mean, I wish we weren’t in the position we were in,” said Hamilton. “I wish we were where we had been, that nice margin for a period of time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "But I guess it means we’ve got to work harder this weekend and I am definitely excited for the battle. Don’t know what we will be able to achieve, Ferrari are often quite quick here but I’m definitely quite hopeful.”
